# 🏥 Massachusetts General Hospital – Patient Encounter and Financial Data Dashboard

Welcome to my data analytics project, which was developed as part of my professional portfolio. This interactive **Power BI report** provides a comprehensive analysis of patient demographics, visit types, insurance coverage, cost distribution, and profitability across departments at Massachusetts General Hospital.

## 📌 Project Overview

The report is designed to offer stakeholders — such as hospital administrators and health data analysts — real-time insights for operational decision-making and financial optimization.

### 🧩 Key Objectives
- Analyze patient visit trends by department and visit type.
- Track payer coverage against total claim costs to assess profitability.
- Identify departments with negative profit margins and possible interventions.
- Provide drill-through capability for in-depth exploration of individual patient encounters.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- **Summary Dashboard:** A high-level overview of total encounters, total claim costs, base encounter costs, and overall profit/loss.
- **Patient Profile:** Breakdown by age group, gender, and insurance provider.
- **Department Performance:** Profitability by department with conditional formatting to highlight underperformers.
- **Encounter-Level Drill-Through:** Click-to-view patient-level cost, coverage, and net outcome.
- **Dynamic Filters:** Interactive slicers for visit type, time period, and payer type.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **DAX** – For calculated columns like Profit (Payer Coverage - Total Claim Cost).
- **Excel** – For preliminary data cleaning and transformation.
- **Hospital Dataset** – Simulated data representing real-world hospital encounters.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Certain departments show recurring **negative profit margins**, especially under specific payer types.
- **Outpatient visits** represent the highest frequency of encounters.
- **Private insurance** provides higher average coverage, contributing to better department profitability.
- **Younger age groups** (18–35) dominate in visit frequency but often result in lower revenue per visit.

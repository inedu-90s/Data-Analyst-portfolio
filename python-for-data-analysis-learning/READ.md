# Week 1: Dataset Explorer Tool

This project is part of my Python for Data Analysis learning journey.  
It loads datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON) and prints:
- Shape (rows x columns)
- Columns
- Data types
- Missing values
- Descriptive statistics

## How to run
```bash
python Week1_Loading_datasets.py
